## Current Status

**Last updated:** 2026-04-15
**Last session completed:** M21 — Exercise Library Expansion: 100+ exercises across 13 categories, Unsplash photos, GIF animation mappings extended, filter/chip UI updated; fixed 2 warnings in photo_recipe_screen.dart (unused _imageBytes field + unused theme variable)
**Next session starts with:** M11 — Testing & Quality (widget tests + unit tests + flutter analyze clean)
**Active branches:** main
**Blockers / notes:** `pubspec.lock` gitignored — run `flutter pub get` at session start. `product_found_sheet.dart` unused untracked — safe to delete. USDA_API_KEY in env.json. Gemini 2.5 Flash needs maxTokens ≥ 8192. M20 manual config: "Confirm email" enabled in Supabase ✅; hCaptcha skipped (no free tier needed for PAAM). M19 deferred: pagination UI, streak RPC, lazy ProgressTrackingScreen, SharedPreferences layer, build/bundle (19.9), perf monitoring (19.10). Pre-existing 44 project-wide info/warnings in gemini_ai_service.dart, body_measurements_card.dart etc. — not blocking.

---

## Milestone 14 — Nutrition Screen Overhaul

> Deep improvements to the Nutrition tab: richer food database, correct calorie math, smarter AI-plan integration, and a cleaner Home page.

### 14.1 — Food Database Expansion ✅
- [x] Write Supabase migration to pre-populate `food_database` with 200+ common foods — 363 verified rows inserted across breakfast, proteins, carbs, vegetables, fruits, dairy, nuts/seeds, Romanian dishes, fast food, snacks, beverages, condiments
- [x] Calorie multiplier formula verified: `calories * (serving_quantity / serving_size)` is correct and consistent with how `AddFoodModalWidget` saves quantities

### 14.2 — AI Plan → Meal Type Picker ✅
- [x] Replace the hard-coded `mealTypeMap` lookup in `ai_meal_plan_section.dart` `_addOptionToDay()`
- [x] When user taps "Add to Today" on an AI meal option, show a `showModalBottomSheet` with 4 meal type chips: Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snack (mapped to DB enums)
- [x] If user cancels, abort the insert (null check + mounted guard)

### 14.3 — Home Page Unique Content ✅
- [x] **Remove** the "Nutrition" section from `main_dashboard_initial_page.dart` (NutritionSummaryWidget + import)
- [x] **Add: Workout Streak card** — queries `workout_logs` for consecutive days; flame icon; "No streak yet" state
- [x] **Add: Daily Fitness Tip** — static list of 30 tips; rotated by `dayOfYear % 30`; lightbulb icon
- [x] **Add: TDEE Snapshot card** — `daily_calorie_goal` + `activity_level` from already-loaded `_userProfile`; activity level pill

### 14.4 — Calorie Formula Hotfix ✅
- [x] Fix RPC `calculate_daily_nutrition_totals`: formula was `calories * serving_quantity * serving_size / 100` (wrong — multiplied instead of divided). Fixed to `calories * serving_quantity / serving_size`
- [x] Fix `AddFoodModalWidget`: now accepts grams directly (default = food's serving_size, e.g. 100 for 100g foods). `serving_quantity` stored in DB is now raw grams, not a multiplier. Formula in preview and RPC are now consistent.

---

## Milestone 15 — Barcode Scanner: Open Food Facts Integration

> Replace the Supabase-only barcode lookup with the free Open Food Facts API (3 M+ products), add a scan cooldown, and create a polished product-found flow identical to apps like Eat & Track.

### 15.1 — OpenFoodFactsService
- [x] Create `lib/services/open_food_facts_service.dart`
  - Method `Future<Map<String, dynamic>?> lookupBarcode(String barcode)`
  - URL: `https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/{barcode}.json` (no API key required)
  - Parse response: extract `product_name`, `nutriments.energy-kcal_100g`, `nutriments.proteins_100g`, `nutriments.carbohydrates_100g`, `nutriments.fat_100g`, `serving_size` (default to 100g if absent), `image_front_url`
  - Wrap in `try/catch` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 15))`
  - Return `null` if status != 1 or product not found

### 15.2 — Barcode Lookup Flow (Supabase → OFF → Not Found)
- [x] Update `BarcodeScannerPage._onBarcodeDetected()` lookup order:
  1. Query local `food_database` (Supabase) by `barcode` column — instant hit for cached items
  2. If not found, call `OpenFoodFactsService.lookupBarcode(barcode)`
  3. If found via OFF: insert product into Supabase `food_database` (`is_verified = false`, `barcode` = scanned value) and return the new row — **cache for next time**
  4. If still not found: pop scanner and show "Product not found" SnackBar on NutritionPlanningScreen
- [x] `barcode` column already present in `food_database` — no migration needed

### 15.3 — Scan Cooldown & Camera Control
- [x] Camera stops immediately (`_controller.stop()`) on first barcode detection — no infinite scan loop
- [x] On error: camera resumes and state resets so user can retry
- [x] `_lastBarcode` guard prevents duplicate detections

### 15.4 — ProductFoundScreen (full page — changed from bottom sheet per UX feedback)
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/nutrition_planning_screen/widgets/product_found_screen.dart`
  - Full Scaffold page (not bottom sheet) — pushed via `Navigator.pushReplacement` from scanner
  - Product image (`CustomImageWidget`), name, brand
  - Macro chips row: kcal / Protein / Carbs / Fat (per 100g)
  - Quantity `TextFormField` with live calorie + macro preview
  - Meal type `ChoiceChip` selector (Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snack)
  - Fixed "Add to Meal" CTA at bottom — calls `NutritionService.logMeal()`, refreshes parent

### 15.5 — Scanner UX Polish
- [x] Animated scan-line inside guide rectangle (`AnimationController`, 2 s repeat-reverse)
- [x] Status chip shows lookup progress ("Looking up barcode…" / "Searching Open Food Facts…")
- [x] Permission-denied empty state: icon + "Camera permission required" + "Open Settings" button

---

## Milestone 16 — Food Database: External API Search Integration

> Extend the food search bar (currently queries only the 363-row local Supabase table) to fetch results from Open Food Facts (text search) and USDA FoodData Central, giving users access to millions of real foods with accurate macronutrients.

### 16.1 — Open Food Facts Text Search
- [x] Add text search method to `OpenFoodFactsService` (created in M15):
  - Method `Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> searchFoods(String query, {int page = 1})`
  - URL: `https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?search_terms={query}&json=1&page_size=20&page={page}`
  - Parse each product: `product_name`, `nutriments.energy-kcal_100g`, `nutriments.proteins_100g`, `nutriments.carbohydrates_100g`, `nutriments.fat_100g`, `serving_size` (default 100g if absent), `image_front_url`
  - Filter out results with missing `energy-kcal_100g` (unusable)
  - Wrap in `try/catch` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 15))`

### 16.2 — USDA FoodData Central Integration
- [x] Create `lib/services/usda_food_service.dart`
  - API key stored in `env.json` as `USDA_API_KEY` (registered and active)
  - Method `Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> searchFoods(String query)`
  - URL: `https://api.nal.usda.gov/fdc/v1/foods/search?query={query}&api_key={key}&pageSize=20`
  - Parse `foods[].description`, `foods[].foodNutrients` (nutrient IDs: 1008=kcal, 1003=protein, 1005=carbs, 1004=fat)
  - Graceful fallback: returns `[]` immediately if key is absent
  - Wrap in `try/catch` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 15))`

### 16.3 — Unified Food Search in NutritionPlanningScreen
- [x] Updated `AddFoodModalWidget` (the active search widget) with **3-tier lookup**:
  1. Query local Supabase `food_database` (instant, shown first)
  2. OFF + USDA always run in parallel in background (no threshold — always fires)
  3. Results appended with source badge chips: Local / Open Food Facts / USDA
- [x] Deduplicate results by normalized `name|brand` key — local takes priority
- [x] Cache any externally-fetched food into Supabase `food_database` (`is_verified = false`) on first use via `NutritionService.cacheExternalFood()`
- [x] DB migration: added `UNIQUE(name, brand)` constraint + deduplicated existing rows + added `image_front_url TEXT` column

### 16.4 — Pagination & UX
- [x] "Load more results" button at bottom of search list (triggers next OFF page)
- [x] Shimmer skeleton (AnimationController) while external APIs are fetching — local results visible immediately
- [x] Empty state: "No results found. Try a different spelling or scan the barcode." / "Start searching for foods"

---

## Milestone 17 — Community Food Database: User Contributions + Nutritional Label OCR

> Allow users to add missing products to the shared food database by scanning the barcode and photographing the nutritional label. Gemini Vision extracts macros automatically. Products added by any user become available to all users on next barcode scan — the database grows with every contribution.

### 17.1 — DB Schema: Extended Food Contributions ✅
- [x] Supabase migration: add `contributed_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NULL` to `food_database`
- [x] Supabase migration: add `is_user_contributed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` to `food_database`
- [x] Supabase migration: add `detailed_macros JSONB NULL` — stores extended nutrition per 100g: `{ sugar, saturated_fat, unsaturated_fat, fiber, sodium }` (values that are not in the main columns)
- [x] Add RLS policy: authenticated users can INSERT rows with `contributed_by = auth.uid()`; can UPDATE/DELETE only rows where `contributed_by = auth.uid()`

### 17.2 — GeminiNutritionLabelService (Vision OCR) ✅
- [x] `image_picker: ^1.0.4` already in `pubspec.yaml` — no change needed
- [x] Create `lib/services/gemini_nutrition_label_service.dart`
  - Method `Future<Map<String, dynamic>?> extractNutritionLabel(Uint8List imageBytes)`
  - Encodes image to base64, calls Gemini multimodal API (`gemini-1.5-flash`) with inline image part
  - System prompt: instructs the model to return STRICT JSON with keys `calories`, `protein_g`, `carbs_g`, `sugar_g`, `fat_g`, `saturated_fat_g`, `unsaturated_fat_g`, `fiber_g`, `sodium_mg`, `serving_size_g` — all values per 100g, null if not found on label
  - Validates JSON shape before returning; returns `null` on parse failure or missing critical fields (`calories`, `protein_g`, `carbs_g`, `fat_g`)
  - Wrap in `try/catch` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 30))` (Vision calls are slower than text)

### 17.3 — ProductNotFoundScreen ✅
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/nutrition_planning_screen/widgets/product_not_found_screen.dart`
  - Full Scaffold page (pushed via `Navigator.pushReplacement` from scanner when all lookup tiers fail)
  - Shows scanned barcode value, "No product found for this barcode" heading
  - Two CTAs: "Scan Again" (pops back to scanner) and "Add This Product" (pushes `UserFoodSubmissionScreen` with `barcode` argument)

### 17.4 — UserFoodSubmissionScreen (3-step wizard) ✅
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/user_food_submission_screen/user_food_submission_screen.dart`
- [x] Step 1 — Product Info: name + brand TextFormFields; barcode pre-filled read-only; "Next" validates
- [x] Step 2 — Label Photo: camera/gallery pick; Gemini Vision extraction with shimmer loading; "Enter Manually" skip
- [x] Step 3 — Review & Submit: required macro fields + optional detailed nutrition ExpansionTile; "Submit Product" validates and calls submitUserFood()
- [x] On submit: navigates to ProductFoundScreen with newly inserted row
- [x] Route `AppRoutes.userFoodSubmission` registered in `app_routes.dart` via `onGenerateRoute`

### 17.5 — Barcode Flow Update: "Not Found → Contribute" ✅
- [x] Update `BarcodeScannerPage._onBarcodeDetected()`: when all lookup tiers return null, push `ProductNotFoundScreen` (replaces pop with kNotFound sentinel)

### 17.6 — NutritionService: submitUserFood() & getMyContributions() ✅
- [x] `submitUserFood()` — inserts with is_user_contributed=true, contributed_by, is_verified=false; stores detailed_macros JSONB; returns inserted row
- [x] `getMyContributions()` — selects where contributed_by = current uid, ordered by created_at DESC
- [x] `deleteContribution()` — deletes by id (RLS enforces own-rows-only)

### 17.7 — Detailed Macros Display in ProductFoundScreen ✅
- [x] `_DetailedMacrosExpansion` widget: ExpansionTile hidden when detailed_macros is null; shows sugar, saturated fat, unsaturated fat, fiber, sodium — per 100g and scaled to entered quantity
- [x] "User Added" Chip badge when `is_user_contributed = true`

### 17.8 — "My Contributions" in User Profile ✅
- [x] "My Food Contributions" ListTile with count badge in UserProfileManagement; count refreshes on return
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/user_food_submission_screen/my_contributions_screen.dart` — shimmer skeleton, swipe-to-delete with confirm dialog, empty state, pull-to-refresh
- [x] Route `AppRoutes.myFoodContributions` registered in `app_routes.dart`

---

## Milestone 18 — Smart Photo-to-Recipe Generator ✅

### 18.6 — Step 2: Ingredients Review
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/photo_recipe_screen/widgets/ingredients_review_step.dart`
  - Shimmer loading state during Gemini Vision call
  - Detected ingredients as removable/editable chips (name + quantity)
  - Category color coding (protein=red, carb=amber, vegetable=green, etc.)
  - "Generate Recipes" CTA (disabled if 0 ingredients) → triggers SmartRecipeService → advances to step 3
  - Empty state: "No food items detected" + retake photo button

### 18.7 — Step 3: Browse Recipes

## Milestone 19 — Performance Optimization & Client-Side Caching

> Make the app feel instant: eliminate redundant network calls, cache aggressively, optimize heavy widgets, and reduce memory pressure from images. Target: every screen loads in <300ms on repeat visits.

### 19.1 — AppCacheService Expansion (In-Memory Cache Layer)
- [x] Extend `AppCacheService` to cache exercise library data (static list — long TTL, 30 min)
- [x] Cache user's active workout plan + sessions (TTL 10 min) — `_activeWorkout` + `_weeklySchedule` fields added; wired to `WeeklyProgressWidget`
- [x] Cache body measurements history (TTL 5 min, invalidate on new measurement) — wired to `BodyMeasurementsCard`
- [x] Cache strength progress / PR data (TTL 5 min) — wired to `StrengthProgressScreen`
- [x] Cache food search results for repeated queries (LRU map, max 20 queries, TTL 3 min) — wired to `AddFoodModalWidget._searchFood()` (check before Supabase/OFF/USDA, set after combining all results)
- [x] Cache `getMyContributions()` results (TTL 5 min, invalidate on add/delete)
- [x] Add `invalidateAll()` call on sign-out — `AuthService.signOut()` now calls it first

### 19.2 — Supabase Query Optimization
- [x] Add `.limit(50)` to `getUserMeals()` and `getMyContributions()` list queries
- [ ] Add pagination to `getMyContributions()` and `getUserMeals()` — fetch 20 at a time with "load more" (deferred)
- [ ] Optimize `_fetchWorkoutStreak()` — replace client-side streak calculation with a Supabase RPC (deferred — requires migration)
- [x] Add `.select()` column projection to WorkoutService queries (getAllWorkoutPlans, getUserActiveWorkout, getAllCategories, getWorkoutPlanDetails join)
- [x] `NutritionPlanningScreen` already uses `Future.wait()` for parallel nutrition calls (confirmed pre-M19)

### 19.3 — Image Performance
- [x] Add `maxWidthDiskCache` / `maxHeightDiskCache` to `CachedNetworkImage` in `CustomImageWidget` (same `.isFinite` guard as `memCacheWidth`)
- [ ] Add `ResizeImage` wrapper for asset images loaded via `Image.asset()` where display size is known (deferred)
- [x] Compress camera-captured images before sending to Gemini Vision — `maxWidth: 1024` in `capture_step.dart` and `user_food_submission_screen.dart` (was 1200)
- [ ] Pre-cache exercise animation frames on `ExerciseLibrary` scroll (deferred — complex)
- [x] Add `fadeInDuration: 200ms` and `memCacheWidth` (with `.isFinite` guard) to `CachedNetworkImage` in `CustomImageWidget`

### 19.4 — Widget Rebuild Optimization
- [x] Extract Photo Recipe CTA from `NutritionPlanningScreen` to `_PhotoRecipeCtaWidget` (stable widget identity, reduces rebuild scope)
- [x] Wrap 4 `SimpleMealCard` instances in `RepaintBoundary` — prevents parent repaints from cascading into cards
- [x] Add `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` — N/A: `IndexedStack` already keeps all tabs alive
- [x] Convert `WeeklyProgressWidget` to cache Supabase query results — `getWeeklySchedule()` + `getActiveWorkout()` cache
- [x] Debounce food search in `AddFoodModalWidget` — 400ms Timer, properly disposed
- [x] Move day-of-year calculation and daily tip selection out of `build()` into `initState()` via `late final String _dailyTip`

### 19.5 — Lazy Loading & Deferred Initialization
- [ ] Lazy-load `ProgressTrackingScreen` child widgets — deferred (significant refactor)
- [x] `google_mlkit_text_recognition` already lazy — only imported in `gemini_nutrition_label_service.dart`
- [x] `youtube_player_flutter` already removed — replaced with free-exercise-db GIFs
- [x] `ScrollController` listener on `ExerciseLibrary` already exists — scroll-driven pagination confirmed

### 19.6 — Network Request Optimization
- [x] Add debounce timer (400ms) to food search in `AddFoodModalWidget`
- [x] HTTP connection pooling — all 3 external API services (OFF, USDA, Gemini) already use singleton Dio instances
- [ ] Add retry with exponential backoff (deferred — risk of introducing bugs in stable flows)
- [ ] Cancel in-flight API requests with CancelToken (deferred — complex)
- [ ] Cache OFF + USDA search results for 10 min (deferred)

### 19.7 — Local Storage & Offline Resilience
- [ ] Persist exercise library / user profile / nutrition to `SharedPreferences` (deferred — in-memory AppCacheService sufficient for session lifetime)
- [x] Add `connectivity_plus` listener — red offline banner in `MainDashboard` via `Stack(fit: StackFit.expand)` + `Positioned` overlay

### 19.8 — Memory Management
- [~] Dispose all controllers — fixed `water_tracking_card.dart` and `ingredients_review_step.dart`; full audit pending
- [x] Clear image cache on background — `MainDashboardState` now extends `WidgetsBindingObserver`; clears `PaintingBinding.imageCache` on `AppLifecycleState.paused`
- [x] Limit photo progress images loaded in memory — converted `PhotoProgressWidget` to `ListView.builder` + `CustomImageWidget` (was `Column + .map()` + bare `Image.network`)
- [x] Strip URL query params from `image_front_url` in `NutritionService.cacheExternalFood()` before upsert — prevents duplicate DB rows for same image with different params

### 19.9 — Build & Bundle Size (deferred — separate config session)
- [x] Run `flutter analyze` — 0 errors in `lib/`; fixed unnecessary imports, string interpolations, `prefer_collection_literals`, redundant `dart:typed_data`; remaining are pre-existing deprecation infos
- [ ] Add `--split-debug-info` and `--obfuscate` to release build command
- [ ] Audit unused packages in `pubspec.yaml`
- [ ] Enable R8/ProGuard shrinking
- [ ] Tree-shake unused Material icons

### 19.10 — Performance Monitoring (deferred)
- [ ] Add `Stopwatch` timing to service methods in debug mode
- [ ] Measure screen transition times
- [ ] Add frame rate monitoring
- [ ] Create performance report
