# TASKS.md — SmartFitAI

Milestone-based task tracker. Mark tasks `[x]` as they are completed.
Update `## Current Status` in `CLAUDE.md` at the end of every session.

## Current Status

**Last updated:** 2026-03-26
**Last session completed:** M15 complete — Open Food Facts barcode integration; ProductFoundScreen full-page flow; scanner stops on first detection
**Next session starts with:** M10 — Workout Session Live Tracking (set-by-set logging with rest timer)
**Active branches:** main
**Blockers / notes:** `pubspec.lock` gitignored — run `flutter pub get` at session start. PAAM/ folder untracked (check if needed for university submission). DB enum values are now fully English — do NOT reintroduce Romanian strings. `product_found_sheet.dart` is an unused untracked file — safe to delete.

---

## Milestone 14 — Nutrition Screen Overhaul

> Deep improvements to the Nutrition tab: richer food database, correct calorie math, smarter AI-plan integration, and a cleaner Home page.

### 14.1 — Food Database Expansion ✅
- [x] Write Supabase migration to pre-populate `food_database` with 200+ common foods — 363 verified rows inserted across breakfast, proteins, carbs, vegetables, fruits, dairy, nuts/seeds, Romanian dishes, fast food, snacks, beverages, condiments
- [x] Calorie multiplier formula verified: `calories * (serving_quantity / serving_size)` is correct and consistent with how `AddFoodModalWidget` saves quantities

### 14.2 — AI Plan → Meal Type Picker ✅
- [x] Replace the hard-coded `mealTypeMap` lookup in `ai_meal_plan_section.dart` `_addOptionToDay()`
- [x] When user taps "Add to Today" on an AI meal option, show a `showModalBottomSheet` with 4 meal type chips: Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snack (mapped to DB enums)
- [x] If user cancels, abort the insert (null check + mounted guard)

### 14.3 — Home Page Unique Content ✅
- [x] **Remove** the "Nutrition" section from `main_dashboard_initial_page.dart` (NutritionSummaryWidget + import)
- [x] **Add: Workout Streak card** — queries `workout_logs` for consecutive days; flame icon; "No streak yet" state
- [x] **Add: Daily Fitness Tip** — static list of 30 tips; rotated by `dayOfYear % 30`; lightbulb icon
- [x] **Add: TDEE Snapshot card** — `daily_calorie_goal` + `activity_level` from already-loaded `_userProfile`; activity level pill

### 14.4 — Calorie Formula Hotfix ✅
- [x] Fix RPC `calculate_daily_nutrition_totals`: formula was `calories * serving_quantity * serving_size / 100` (wrong — multiplied instead of divided). Fixed to `calories * serving_quantity / serving_size`
- [x] Fix `AddFoodModalWidget`: now accepts grams directly (default = food's serving_size, e.g. 100 for 100g foods). `serving_quantity` stored in DB is now raw grams, not a multiplier. Formula in preview and RPC are now consistent.

---

## Milestone 15 — Barcode Scanner: Open Food Facts Integration

> Replace the Supabase-only barcode lookup with the free Open Food Facts API (3 M+ products), add a scan cooldown, and create a polished product-found flow identical to apps like Eat & Track.

### 15.1 — OpenFoodFactsService
- [x] Create `lib/services/open_food_facts_service.dart`
  - Method `Future<Map<String, dynamic>?> lookupBarcode(String barcode)`
  - URL: `https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/{barcode}.json` (no API key required)
  - Parse response: extract `product_name`, `nutriments.energy-kcal_100g`, `nutriments.proteins_100g`, `nutriments.carbohydrates_100g`, `nutriments.fat_100g`, `serving_size` (default to 100g if absent), `image_front_url`
  - Wrap in `try/catch` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 15))`
  - Return `null` if status != 1 or product not found

### 15.2 — Barcode Lookup Flow (Supabase → OFF → Not Found)
- [x] Update `BarcodeScannerPage._onBarcodeDetected()` lookup order:
  1. Query local `food_database` (Supabase) by `barcode` column — instant hit for cached items
  2. If not found, call `OpenFoodFactsService.lookupBarcode(barcode)`
  3. If found via OFF: insert product into Supabase `food_database` (`is_verified = false`, `barcode` = scanned value) and return the new row — **cache for next time**
  4. If still not found: pop scanner and show "Product not found" SnackBar on NutritionPlanningScreen
- [x] `barcode` column already present in `food_database` — no migration needed

### 15.3 — Scan Cooldown & Camera Control
- [x] Camera stops immediately (`_controller.stop()`) on first barcode detection — no infinite scan loop
- [x] On error: camera resumes and state resets so user can retry
- [x] `_lastBarcode` guard prevents duplicate detections

### 15.4 — ProductFoundScreen (full page — changed from bottom sheet per UX feedback)
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/nutrition_planning_screen/widgets/product_found_screen.dart`
  - Full Scaffold page (not bottom sheet) — pushed via `Navigator.pushReplacement` from scanner
  - Product image (`CustomImageWidget`), name, brand
  - Macro chips row: kcal / Protein / Carbs / Fat (per 100g)
  - Quantity `TextFormField` with live calorie + macro preview
  - Meal type `ChoiceChip` selector (Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snack)
  - Fixed "Add to Meal" CTA at bottom — calls `NutritionService.logMeal()`, refreshes parent

### 15.5 — Scanner UX Polish
- [x] Animated scan-line inside guide rectangle (`AnimationController`, 2 s repeat-reverse)
- [x] Status chip shows lookup progress ("Looking up barcode…" / "Searching Open Food Facts…")
- [x] Permission-denied empty state: icon + "Camera permission required" + "Open Settings" button

## Milestone 16 — Food Database: External API Search Integration

> Extend the food search bar (currently queries only the 363-row local Supabase table) to fetch results from Open Food Facts (text search) and USDA FoodData Central, giving users access to millions of real foods with accurate macronutrients.

### 16.1 — Open Food Facts Text Search
- [ ] Add text search method to `OpenFoodFactsService` (created in M15):
  - Method `Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> searchFoods(String query, {int page = 1})`
  - URL: `https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?search_terms={query}&json=1&page_size=20&page={page}`
  - Parse each product: `product_name`, `nutriments.energy-kcal_100g`, `nutriments.proteins_100g`, `nutriments.carbohydrates_100g`, `nutriments.fat_100g`, `serving_size` (default 100g if absent), `image_front_url`
  - Filter out results with missing `energy-kcal_100g` (unusable)
  - Wrap in `try/catch` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 15))`

### 16.2 — USDA FoodData Central Integration
- [ ] Create `lib/services/usda_food_service.dart`
  - API key obtained free from `https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html` — store in `env.json` as `USDA_API_KEY`
  - Method `Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> searchFoods(String query)`
  - URL: `https://api.nal.usda.gov/fdc/v1/foods/search?query={query}&api_key={key}&pageSize=20`
  - Parse `foods[].description`, `foods[].foodNutrients` (nutrient IDs: 1008=kcal, 1003=protein, 1005=carbs, 1004=fat)
  - Use for base/generic foods (chicken breast, rice, eggs) where OFF has weak coverage
  - Wrap in `try/catch` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 15))`

### 16.3 — Unified Food Search in NutritionPlanningScreen
- [ ] Update `FoodSearchDialog` (or equivalent search widget) to use a **3-tier lookup**:
  1. Query local Supabase `food_database` (instant, shown first)
  2. If local results < 5, call `OpenFoodFactsService.searchFoods(query)` — append to results with "From Open Food Facts" badge
  3. If query looks like a generic food (no brand), also call `UsdaFoodService.searchFoods(query)` — append with "USDA" badge
- [ ] Deduplicate results by normalized name (avoid showing same food twice)
- [ ] Show source badge chip on each result card: "Local" / "Open Food Facts" / "USDA"
- [ ] Cache any externally-fetched food into Supabase `food_database` (`is_verified = false`) on first use — so repeated searches are instant

### 16.4 — Pagination & UX
- [ ] Add "Load more results" button at bottom of search list (triggers next page from OFF API)
- [ ] Show loading shimmer while external APIs are fetching (local results visible immediately)
- [ ] If all 3 sources return 0 results: show empty state with "Try a different spelling or scan the barcode"

---

## Backlog (Nice to Have)

- [ ] Push notifications for workout reminders (daily reminder at user-set time)
- [ ] Stripe premium subscription flow (`STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is already configured in env)
- [ ] Google OAuth sign-in (OAuth client ID is in env but not wired up)
- [ ] Offline mode — cache last AI plan and exercise data locally
- [ ] Workout plan sharing (generate shareable link or image)
- [ ] Weekly summary push notification (calories, workouts completed)
- [ ] Apple Health / Google Fit integration for step count and heart rate
