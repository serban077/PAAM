## Current Status

**Last updated:** 2026-04-23
**Last session completed:** M30 — Testing, CI & Quality Gate: dev_deps mocktail ^1.0.4 + coverage ^1.9.2; test/helpers/test_app_wrapper.dart (buildTestApp + pumpGoldenWidget + setPhoneViewport + ignoreOverflowErrors helpers); 63 CalorieCalculatorService unit tests (all static methods); 23 AppCacheService unit tests (singleton reset via invalidateAll); 16 widget tests (CustomBottomBar×4, PasswordStrengthIndicator×7, LoginScreen×5 with Supabase stub init); golden stubs for CustomBottomBar/CustomAppBar/ExerciseCardWidget (PNG files generated on ubuntu CI via update-goldens workflow); .github/workflows/ci.yml (analyze→unit→widget→golden→coverage); .github/workflows/update-goldens.yml (manual workflow_dispatch); scripts/pre-commit.sh + scripts/setup-hooks.sh; integration_test/ stubs (markTestSkipped); flutter test test/unit/ test/widget/: **79/79 passed**; flutter analyze lib/: **0 issues**
**Next session starts with:** M31 — Build, Bundle & Startup Optimization
**Active branches:** main
**Blockers / notes:** `pubspec.lock` gitignored — run `flutter pub get` at session start. `kotlin.incremental=false` android/gradle.properties required for cross-drive Windows build. Golden PNG files must be generated via GitHub Actions "Update Goldens" workflow_dispatch (never on Windows). Ahem test font makes proportional-text Row tests overflow — use ignoreOverflowErrors() helper for affected tests. Supabase stub init pattern (in setUpAll) required for any widget test that loads a screen with AuthService field initializer. M30 deferred: OnboardingSurveyScreen/NutritionPlanningScreen widget tests, TTL cache tests, Patrol integration tests, AuthService/NutritionService unit tests.

---

## Milestone 14 — Nutrition Screen Overhaul

> Deep improvements to the Nutrition tab: richer food database, correct calorie math, smarter AI-plan integration, and a cleaner Home page.

### 14.1 — Food Database Expansion ✅
- [x] Write Supabase migration to pre-populate `food_database` with 200+ common foods — 363 verified rows inserted across breakfast, proteins, carbs, vegetables, fruits, dairy, nuts/seeds, Romanian dishes, fast food, snacks, beverages, condiments
- [x] Calorie multiplier formula verified: `calories * (serving_quantity / serving_size)` is correct and consistent with how `AddFoodModalWidget` saves quantities

### 14.2 — AI Plan → Meal Type Picker ✅
- [x] Replace the hard-coded `mealTypeMap` lookup in `ai_meal_plan_section.dart` `_addOptionToDay()`
- [x] When user taps "Add to Today" on an AI meal option, show a `showModalBottomSheet` with 4 meal type chips: Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snack (mapped to DB enums)
- [x] If user cancels, abort the insert (null check + mounted guard)

### 14.3 — Home Page Unique Content ✅
- [x] **Remove** the "Nutrition" section from `main_dashboard_initial_page.dart` (NutritionSummaryWidget + import)
- [x] **Add: Workout Streak card** — queries `workout_logs` for consecutive days; flame icon; "No streak yet" state
- [x] **Add: Daily Fitness Tip** — static list of 30 tips; rotated by `dayOfYear % 30`; lightbulb icon
- [x] **Add: TDEE Snapshot card** — `daily_calorie_goal` + `activity_level` from already-loaded `_userProfile`; activity level pill

### 14.4 — Calorie Formula Hotfix ✅
- [x] Fix RPC `calculate_daily_nutrition_totals`: formula was `calories * serving_quantity * serving_size / 100` (wrong — multiplied instead of divided). Fixed to `calories * serving_quantity / serving_size`
- [x] Fix `AddFoodModalWidget`: now accepts grams directly (default = food's serving_size, e.g. 100 for 100g foods). `serving_quantity` stored in DB is now raw grams, not a multiplier. Formula in preview and RPC are now consistent.

---

## Milestone 15 — Barcode Scanner: Open Food Facts Integration

> Replace the Supabase-only barcode lookup with the free Open Food Facts API (3 M+ products), add a scan cooldown, and create a polished product-found flow identical to apps like Eat & Track.

### 15.1 — OpenFoodFactsService
- [x] Create `lib/services/open_food_facts_service.dart`
  - Method `Future<Map<String, dynamic>?> lookupBarcode(String barcode)`
  - URL: `https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/{barcode}.json` (no API key required)
  - Parse response: extract `product_name`, `nutriments.energy-kcal_100g`, `nutriments.proteins_100g`, `nutriments.carbohydrates_100g`, `nutriments.fat_100g`, `serving_size` (default to 100g if absent), `image_front_url`
  - Wrap in `try/catch` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 15))`
  - Return `null` if status != 1 or product not found

### 15.2 — Barcode Lookup Flow (Supabase → OFF → Not Found)
- [x] Update `BarcodeScannerPage._onBarcodeDetected()` lookup order:
  1. Query local `food_database` (Supabase) by `barcode` column — instant hit for cached items
  2. If not found, call `OpenFoodFactsService.lookupBarcode(barcode)`
  3. If found via OFF: insert product into Supabase `food_database` (`is_verified = false`, `barcode` = scanned value) and return the new row — **cache for next time**
  4. If still not found: pop scanner and show "Product not found" SnackBar on NutritionPlanningScreen
- [x] `barcode` column already present in `food_database` — no migration needed

### 15.3 — Scan Cooldown & Camera Control
- [x] Camera stops immediately (`_controller.stop()`) on first barcode detection — no infinite scan loop
- [x] On error: camera resumes and state resets so user can retry
- [x] `_lastBarcode` guard prevents duplicate detections

### 15.4 — ProductFoundScreen (full page — changed from bottom sheet per UX feedback)
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/nutrition_planning_screen/widgets/product_found_screen.dart`
  - Full Scaffold page (not bottom sheet) — pushed via `Navigator.pushReplacement` from scanner
  - Product image (`CustomImageWidget`), name, brand
  - Macro chips row: kcal / Protein / Carbs / Fat (per 100g)
  - Quantity `TextFormField` with live calorie + macro preview
  - Meal type `ChoiceChip` selector (Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snack)
  - Fixed "Add to Meal" CTA at bottom — calls `NutritionService.logMeal()`, refreshes parent

### 15.5 — Scanner UX Polish
- [x] Animated scan-line inside guide rectangle (`AnimationController`, 2 s repeat-reverse)
- [x] Status chip shows lookup progress ("Looking up barcode…" / "Searching Open Food Facts…")
- [x] Permission-denied empty state: icon + "Camera permission required" + "Open Settings" button

---

## Milestone 16 — Food Database: External API Search Integration

> Extend the food search bar (currently queries only the 363-row local Supabase table) to fetch results from Open Food Facts (text search) and USDA FoodData Central, giving users access to millions of real foods with accurate macronutrients.

### 16.1 — Open Food Facts Text Search
- [x] Add text search method to `OpenFoodFactsService` (created in M15):
  - Method `Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> searchFoods(String query, {int page = 1})`
  - URL: `https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?search_terms={query}&json=1&page_size=20&page={page}`
  - Parse each product: `product_name`, `nutriments.energy-kcal_100g`, `nutriments.proteins_100g`, `nutriments.carbohydrates_100g`, `nutriments.fat_100g`, `serving_size` (default 100g if absent), `image_front_url`
  - Filter out results with missing `energy-kcal_100g` (unusable)
  - Wrap in `try/catch` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 15))`

### 16.2 — USDA FoodData Central Integration
- [x] Create `lib/services/usda_food_service.dart`
  - API key stored in `env.json` as `USDA_API_KEY` (registered and active)
  - Method `Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> searchFoods(String query)`
  - URL: `https://api.nal.usda.gov/fdc/v1/foods/search?query={query}&api_key={key}&pageSize=20`
  - Parse `foods[].description`, `foods[].foodNutrients` (nutrient IDs: 1008=kcal, 1003=protein, 1005=carbs, 1004=fat)
  - Graceful fallback: returns `[]` immediately if key is absent
  - Wrap in `try/catch` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 15))`

### 16.3 — Unified Food Search in NutritionPlanningScreen
- [x] Updated `AddFoodModalWidget` (the active search widget) with **3-tier lookup**:
  1. Query local Supabase `food_database` (instant, shown first)
  2. OFF + USDA always run in parallel in background (no threshold — always fires)
  3. Results appended with source badge chips: Local / Open Food Facts / USDA
- [x] Deduplicate results by normalized `name|brand` key — local takes priority
- [x] Cache any externally-fetched food into Supabase `food_database` (`is_verified = false`) on first use via `NutritionService.cacheExternalFood()`
- [x] DB migration: added `UNIQUE(name, brand)` constraint + deduplicated existing rows + added `image_front_url TEXT` column

### 16.4 — Pagination & UX
- [x] "Load more results" button at bottom of search list (triggers next OFF page)
- [x] Shimmer skeleton (AnimationController) while external APIs are fetching — local results visible immediately
- [x] Empty state: "No results found. Try a different spelling or scan the barcode." / "Start searching for foods"

## Milestone 17 — Community Food Database: User Contributions + Nutritional Label OCR

> Allow users to add missing products to the shared food database by scanning the barcode and photographing the nutritional label. Gemini Vision extracts macros automatically. Products added by any user become available to all users on next barcode scan — the database grows with every contribution.

### 17.1 — DB Schema: Extended Food Contributions ✅
- [x] Supabase migration: add `contributed_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NULL` to `food_database`
- [x] Supabase migration: add `is_user_contributed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` to `food_database`
- [x] Supabase migration: add `detailed_macros JSONB NULL` — stores extended nutrition per 100g: `{ sugar, saturated_fat, unsaturated_fat, fiber, sodium }` (values that are not in the main columns)
- [x] Add RLS policy: authenticated users can INSERT rows with `contributed_by = auth.uid()`; can UPDATE/DELETE only rows where `contributed_by = auth.uid()`

### 17.2 — GeminiNutritionLabelService (Vision OCR) ✅
- [x] `image_picker: ^1.0.4` already in `pubspec.yaml` — no change needed
- [x] Create `lib/services/gemini_nutrition_label_service.dart`
  - Method `Future<Map<String, dynamic>?> extractNutritionLabel(Uint8List imageBytes)`
  - Encodes image to base64, calls Gemini multimodal API (`gemini-1.5-flash`) with inline image part
  - System prompt: instructs the model to return STRICT JSON with keys `calories`, `protein_g`, `carbs_g`, `sugar_g`, `fat_g`, `saturated_fat_g`, `unsaturated_fat_g`, `fiber_g`, `sodium_mg`, `serving_size_g` — all values per 100g, null if not found on label
  - Validates JSON shape before returning; returns `null` on parse failure or missing critical fields (`calories`, `protein_g`, `carbs_g`, `fat_g`)
  - Wrap in `try/catch` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 30))` (Vision calls are slower than text)

### 17.3 — ProductNotFoundScreen ✅
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/nutrition_planning_screen/widgets/product_not_found_screen.dart`
  - Full Scaffold page (pushed via `Navigator.pushReplacement` from scanner when all lookup tiers fail)
  - Shows scanned barcode value, "No product found for this barcode" heading
  - Two CTAs: "Scan Again" (pops back to scanner) and "Add This Product" (pushes `UserFoodSubmissionScreen` with `barcode` argument)

### 17.4 — UserFoodSubmissionScreen (3-step wizard) ✅
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/user_food_submission_screen/user_food_submission_screen.dart`
- [x] Step 1 — Product Info: name + brand TextFormFields; barcode pre-filled read-only; "Next" validates
- [x] Step 2 — Label Photo: camera/gallery pick; Gemini Vision extraction with shimmer loading; "Enter Manually" skip
- [x] Step 3 — Review & Submit: required macro fields + optional detailed nutrition ExpansionTile; "Submit Product" validates and calls submitUserFood()
- [x] On submit: navigates to ProductFoundScreen with newly inserted row
- [x] Route `AppRoutes.userFoodSubmission` registered in `app_routes.dart` via `onGenerateRoute`

### 17.5 — Barcode Flow Update: "Not Found → Contribute" ✅
- [x] Update `BarcodeScannerPage._onBarcodeDetected()`: when all lookup tiers return null, push `ProductNotFoundScreen` (replaces pop with kNotFound sentinel)

### 17.6 — NutritionService: submitUserFood() & getMyContributions() ✅
- [x] `submitUserFood()` — inserts with is_user_contributed=true, contributed_by, is_verified=false; stores detailed_macros JSONB; returns inserted row
- [x] `getMyContributions()` — selects where contributed_by = current uid, ordered by created_at DESC
- [x] `deleteContribution()` — deletes by id (RLS enforces own-rows-only)

### 17.7 — Detailed Macros Display in ProductFoundScreen ✅
- [x] `_DetailedMacrosExpansion` widget: ExpansionTile hidden when detailed_macros is null; shows sugar, saturated fat, unsaturated fat, fiber, sodium — per 100g and scaled to entered quantity
- [x] "User Added" Chip badge when `is_user_contributed = true`

### 17.8 — "My Contributions" in User Profile ✅
- [x] "My Food Contributions" ListTile with count badge in UserProfileManagement; count refreshes on return
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/user_food_submission_screen/my_contributions_screen.dart` — shimmer skeleton, swipe-to-delete with confirm dialog, empty state, pull-to-refresh
- [x] Route `AppRoutes.myFoodContributions` registered in `app_routes.dart`

---

## Milestone 18 — Smart Photo-to-Recipe Generator ✅

  - `GeneratedRecipe` (name, description, prepTime, cookTime, servings, difficulty, ingredients, steps, macrosPerServing)
  - `RecipeGenerationResult` (recipes list, rawResponse)
  - All classes: `fromMap()` + `toMap()` constructors

### 18.2 — FoodRecognitionService (Gemini Vision)
- [x] Create `lib/services/food_recognition_service.dart`
  - Method `Future<FoodRecognitionResult> recognizeIngredients(Uint8List imageBytes)`
  - Base64-encode image → Gemini 2.5 Flash multimodal call (temperature 0.1, maxTokens 8192)
  - Prompt: identify all food items, return JSON array with name/estimated_quantity_g/category
  - Parse response → `FoodRecognitionResult`
  - try/catch + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 45))`

### 18.3 — SmartRecipeService (Recipe Generation)
- [x] Create `lib/services/smart_recipe_service.dart`
  - Method `Future<RecipeGenerationResult> generateRecipes(List<DetectedIngredient> ingredients)`
  - Fetches user TDEE/macro goals via `CalorieCalculatorService`
  - Text-only Gemini call (temperature 0.7, maxTokens 8192)
  - Prompt: generate 3-5 diverse protein-rich recipes using ONLY the listed ingredients; include gram amounts + macros per serving
  - Parse response → `RecipeGenerationResult`
  - try/catch + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 45))`

### 18.4 — PhotoRecipeScreen: Wizard Shell
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/photo_recipe_screen/photo_recipe_screen.dart`
  - PageView + PageController + NeverScrollableScrollPhysics (same pattern as UserFoodSubmissionScreen)
  - 4 steps: Capture → Ingredients Review → Recipes → Log Meal
  - Step indicator widget at top
  - Back button per step (pops on step 1)

### 18.5 — Step 1: Capture Photo
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/photo_recipe_screen/widgets/capture_step.dart`
  - Camera + gallery pick via `image_picker` (imageQuality: 85, maxWidth: 1200)
  - Image preview with retake button
  - "Analyze Ingredients" CTA → triggers FoodRecognitionService → advances to step 2

### 18.6 — Step 2: Ingredients Review
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/photo_recipe_screen/widgets/ingredients_review_step.dart`
  - Shimmer loading state during Gemini Vision call
  - Detected ingredients as removable/editable chips (name + quantity)
  - Category color coding (protein=red, carb=amber, vegetable=green, etc.)
  - "Generate Recipes" CTA (disabled if 0 ingredients) → triggers SmartRecipeService → advances to step 3
  - Empty state: "No food items detected" + retake photo button

### 18.7 — Step 3: Browse Recipes
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/photo_recipe_screen/widgets/recipes_step.dart`
  - Shimmer loading state during recipe generation
  - Card list of 3-5 recipes: name, description, prep+cook time, difficulty badge, calorie/protein preview
  - Tap card → bottom sheet with full recipe detail (ingredients with grams, steps, full macros)
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/photo_recipe_screen/widgets/recipe_detail_sheet.dart`
  - Scrollable bottom sheet: recipe name, macros summary row, ingredient list (with gram amounts), numbered steps
  - "Log This Meal" CTA at bottom → advances to step 4 with selected recipe

### 18.8 — Step 4: Log Recipe as Meal
- [x] Create `lib/presentation/photo_recipe_screen/widgets/log_recipe_step.dart`
  - Selected recipe summary (name, macros per serving)
  - Meal type picker: Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snack (ChoiceChips, same pattern as ProductFoundScreen)
  - Serving count selector (default 1, range 1–10)

## Milestone 19 — Performance Optimization & Client-Side Caching

> Make the app feel instant: eliminate redundant network calls, cache aggressively, optimize heavy widgets, and reduce memory pressure from images. Target: every screen loads in <300ms on repeat visits.

### 19.1 — AppCacheService Expansion (In-Memory Cache Layer)
- [x] Extend `AppCacheService` to cache exercise library data (static list — long TTL, 30 min)
- [x] Cache user's active workout plan + sessions (TTL 10 min) — `_activeWorkout` + `_weeklySchedule` fields added; wired to `WeeklyProgressWidget`
- [x] Cache body measurements history (TTL 5 min, invalidate on new measurement) — wired to `BodyMeasurementsCard`
- [x] Cache strength progress / PR data (TTL 5 min) — wired to `StrengthProgressScreen`
- [x] Cache food search results for repeated queries (LRU map, max 20 queries, TTL 3 min) — wired to `AddFoodModalWidget._searchFood()` (check before Supabase/OFF/USDA, set after combining all results)
- [x] Cache `getMyContributions()` results (TTL 5 min, invalidate on add/delete)
- [x] Add `invalidateAll()` call on sign-out — `AuthService.signOut()` now calls it first

### 19.2 — Supabase Query Optimization
- [x] Add `.limit(50)` to `getUserMeals()` and `getMyContributions()` list queries
- [ ] Add pagination to `getMyContributions()` and `getUserMeals()` — fetch 20 at a time with "load more" (deferred)
- [ ] Optimize `_fetchWorkoutStreak()` — replace client-side streak calculation with a Supabase RPC (deferred — requires migration)
- [x] Add `.select()` column projection to WorkoutService queries (getAllWorkoutPlans, getUserActiveWorkout, getAllCategories, getWorkoutPlanDetails join)
- [x] `NutritionPlanningScreen` already uses `Future.wait()` for parallel nutrition calls (confirmed pre-M19)

### 19.3 — Image Performance
- [x] Add `maxWidthDiskCache` / `maxHeightDiskCache` to `CachedNetworkImage` in `CustomImageWidget` (same `.isFinite` guard as `memCacheWidth`)
- [ ] Add `ResizeImage` wrapper for asset images loaded via `Image.asset()` where display size is known (deferred)
- [x] Compress camera-captured images before sending to Gemini Vision — `maxWidth: 1024` in `capture_step.dart` and `user_food_submission_screen.dart` (was 1200)
- [ ] Pre-cache exercise animation frames on `ExerciseLibrary` scroll (deferred — complex)
- [x] Add `fadeInDuration: 200ms` and `memCacheWidth` (with `.isFinite` guard) to `CachedNetworkImage` in `CustomImageWidget`

### 19.4 — Widget Rebuild Optimization
- [x] Extract Photo Recipe CTA from `NutritionPlanningScreen` to `_PhotoRecipeCtaWidget` (stable widget identity, reduces rebuild scope)
- [x] Wrap 4 `SimpleMealCard` instances in `RepaintBoundary` — prevents parent repaints from cascading into cards
- [x] Add `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` — N/A: `IndexedStack` already keeps all tabs alive
- [x] Convert `WeeklyProgressWidget` to cache Supabase query results — `getWeeklySchedule()` + `getActiveWorkout()` cache
- [x] Debounce food search in `AddFoodModalWidget` — 400ms Timer, properly disposed
- [x] Move day-of-year calculation and daily tip selection out of `build()` into `initState()` via `late final String _dailyTip`

### 19.5 — Lazy Loading & Deferred Initialization
- [ ] Lazy-load `ProgressTrackingScreen` child widgets — deferred (significant refactor)
- [x] `google_mlkit_text_recognition` already lazy — only imported in `gemini_nutrition_label_service.dart`
- [x] `youtube_player_flutter` already removed — replaced with free-exercise-db GIFs
- [x] `ScrollController` listener on `ExerciseLibrary` already exists — scroll-driven pagination confirmed

### 19.6 — Network Request Optimization
- [x] Add debounce timer (400ms) to food search in `AddFoodModalWidget`
- [x] HTTP connection pooling — all 3 external API services (OFF, USDA, Gemini) already use singleton Dio instances
- [ ] Add retry with exponential backoff (deferred — risk of introducing bugs in stable flows)
- [ ] Cancel in-flight API requests with CancelToken (deferred — complex)
- [ ] Cache OFF + USDA search results for 10 min (deferred)

### 19.7 — Local Storage & Offline Resilience
- [ ] Persist exercise library / user profile / nutrition to `SharedPreferences` (deferred — in-memory AppCacheService sufficient for session lifetime)
- [x] Add `connectivity_plus` listener — red offline banner in `MainDashboard` via `Stack(fit: StackFit.expand)` + `Positioned` overlay

### 19.8 — Memory Management
- [~] Dispose all controllers — fixed `water_tracking_card.dart` and `ingredients_review_step.dart`; full audit pending
- [x] Clear image cache on background — `MainDashboardState` now extends `WidgetsBindingObserver`; clears `PaintingBinding.imageCache` on `AppLifecycleState.paused`
- [x] Limit photo progress images loaded in memory — converted `PhotoProgressWidget` to `ListView.builder` + `CustomImageWidget` (was `Column + .map()` + bare `Image.network`)
- [x] Strip URL query params from `image_front_url` in `NutritionService.cacheExternalFood()` before upsert — prevents duplicate DB rows for same image with different params

### 19.9 — Build & Bundle Size (deferred — separate config session)
- [x] Run `flutter analyze` — 0 errors in `lib/`; fixed unnecessary imports, string interpolations, `prefer_collection_literals`, redundant `dart:typed_data`; remaining are pre-existing deprecation infos
- [ ] Add `--split-debug-info` and `--obfuscate` to release build command
- [ ] Audit unused packages in `pubspec.yaml`
- [ ] Enable R8/ProGuard shrinking
- [ ] Tree-shake unused Material icons

### 19.10 — Performance Monitoring (deferred)
- [ ] Add `Stopwatch` timing to service methods in debug mode
- [ ] Measure screen transition times
- [ ] Add frame rate monitoring
- [ ] Create performance report

---

## Milestone 22 — App Health Audit & Baseline Metrics

> Measure before optimizing. Establish hard numbers for every perf metric so later milestones have a reference point. All baseline values go into `docs/AUDIT_BASELINE.md`.

### 22.1 — Static Analysis & Lint Baseline
- [x] Run `flutter analyze` and record exact warning/info count per file — **125 issues: 0 errors (main app), ~10 warnings, ~100 infos, 7 errors in PAAM subfolder**
- [x] Fix remaining pre-existing lints — **flutter analyze lib/ → 0 issues**: withOpacity→withValues(alpha:) ×8 files, value:→initialValue: DropdownButtonFormField ×6 occurrences, use_build_context_synchronously ×5 files, Radio→RadioGroup migration ×4 steps, debugPrint import fix, unnecessary_to_list_in_spreads fix, 2 raw print()→debugPrint
- [x] Audit and delete `lib/presentation/nutrition_planning_screen/widgets/product_found_sheet.dart` — **deleted**
- [x] Grep for leftover `print(` / `TODO` / `FIXME` in `lib/` — **2 raw print() in gemini_ai_service.dart; 1 TODO in onboarding_survey_widget.dart; 0 FIXME/HACK**
- [ ] Add stricter lint ruleset via `very_good_analysis` or custom `analysis_options.yaml` (optional — pending user decision)

### 22.2 — Dependency Audit
- [x] Run `flutter pub outdated` — **16 direct deps upgradable: 8 major (sizer/camera/fl_chart/connectivity_plus/flutter_secure_storage/fluttertoast/google_fonts/intl/local_auth/permission_handler), 8 minor (dio/flutter_svg/mobile_scanner/shared_preferences/supabase_flutter/google_mlkit_text_recognition)**
- [x] Identify unused dependencies — **4 confirmed unused (zero imports in lib/): camera, youtube_player_flutter, universal_html, before_after**
- [x] `js` package flagged as **DISCONTINUED** by Dart team (transitive dep)
- [ ] Verify each package is still maintained (last commit < 12 months)

### 22.3 — Performance Baseline Measurement
- [ ] Cold start time (`flutter run --trace-startup --profile`) — record for each of the 3 primary flows: login, dashboard, exercise library **[DEFERRED — needs device]**
- [~] APK size (`flutter build apk --analyze-size`) — **BUILD FAILED: R8 missing ProGuard rules for google_mlkit_text_recognition. Fix ready in docs/AUDIT_BASELINE.md §3a. Re-run after M31.1.**
- [ ] Frame rendering per screen (`flutter run --profile` + DevTools Performance) **[DEFERRED — needs device]**
- [ ] Memory footprint idle + after 5 min navigation loop (DevTools Memory) **[DEFERRED — needs device]**
- [ ] Count total widget rebuilds on dashboard using DevTools "Track Widget Builds" **[DEFERRED — needs device]**

### 22.4 — DB Advisor Reports
- [x] Run `mcp__supabase__get_advisors` security — **13 WARN: 10 mutable search_path functions, 2 permissive food_database policies, 1 leaked password protection disabled**
- [x] Run `mcp__supabase__get_advisors` performance — **72 issues: 28 WARN auth_rls_initplan (auth.uid() re-evaluated per row), 14 WARN multiple_permissive_policies, 13 INFO unindexed FKs, 17 INFO unused indexes**
- [x] Run `mcp__supabase__get_logs` postgres — **CLEAN: 0 errors, only connection + checkpoint events**
- [x] All findings documented in `docs/AUDIT_BASELINE.md`
- [x] **FIXED (M22 fix pass):** 29 auth_rls_initplan → `(SELECT auth.uid())` migration applied; 10 function_search_path_mutable → `SET search_path = public, pg_catalog` applied; 13 unindexed FK → indexes created; duplicate food_database policies dropped; exercises/session_exercises/workout_sessions multiple permissive policies consolidated
- [x] **FIXED:** workout_plans 3-policy overlap — dropped 2 legacy creator_id policies, migrated 2 rows to user_id; dropped 29 old unused non-FK indexes; re-added FK covering indexes for all 16 FK columns
- [ ] **Remaining (intentional/manual):** 2 food_database rls_policy_always_true (by design — any auth user can add/edit foods), unused_index INFO on FK indexes (new, will clear with query traffic), leaked_password_protection (enable manually: Dashboard → Auth → Password Security)

### 22.5 — Baseline Document
- [x] Created `docs/AUDIT_BASELINE.md` — full report with static analysis, deps, build, DB health, priority fix queue
- [ ] Runtime section (§5 of baseline doc) — fill in with device measurements before starting M33

## Milestone 23 — High Refresh Rate & UI Fluidity

> Make the app feel buttery-smooth. Unlock 90/120Hz displays, eliminate jank frames, cut widget rebuilds, upgrade animations to a declarative system. Biggest perceived-fluency win.

### 23.1 — High Refresh Rate Display Support
- [x] Add `flutter_displaymode: ^0.6.0` to `pubspec.yaml`
- [x] In `main.dart`, call `FlutterDisplayMode.setHighRefreshRate()` after `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`

- [x] Replace dashboard `_buildLoadingScreen()` static placeholders with `Skeletonizer(enabled: _isLoading)` wrapping real content
- [x] Replace exercise library `_buildSkeletonCard()` with `Skeletonizer`-wrapped real `ExerciseCardWidget` using dummy data
- [x] Keep `shimmer` for AI loading widgets with custom skeleton shapes

### 23.4 — Widget Rebuild Reduction
- [~] DevTools "Track Widget Builds" — top 10 rebuild hotspots **[DEFERRED — needs device]**
- [x] `dart fix --apply` — 0 to fix (already clean from M22 pass)
- [x] Wrap `WeeklyProgressWidget` in `RepaintBoundary` (fl_chart repaints)
- [x] Wrap `_buildWorkoutStreakCard` in `RepaintBoundary` (animated streak ring)

### 23.5 — Scroll Performance
- [x] `cacheExtent: 500` on exercise library `ListView.builder`
- [x] Exercise library already uses `ListView.builder` with pagination ✅
- [~] `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` — N/A: `IndexedStack` already keeps all tabs alive ✅

### 23.6 — Motion & Micro-interactions
- [x] Press scale animation on `ExerciseCardWidget` — `AnimatedScale` 1.0→0.97, 80ms (`StatelessWidget` → `StatefulWidget`)
- [x] Staggered entrance on exercise list items — `.animate(delay: (index % 10) * 40ms).fade(300ms).slideY(0.08→0, 300ms)`
- [ ] Loading → success checkmark animation on "Log Meal" / "Mark Eaten" (deferred)

---

## Milestone 24 — Image & Asset Optimization

> Images are the heaviest asset class. Compress, cache smarter, strip metadata, and pre-resolve sizes so memory stays low and scroll stays smooth.

### 24.1 — Bundled Asset Compression
- [x] Audit every file in `assets/images/` — record current size + format
- [x] Convert PNG/JPG to WebP where visual quality allows (typically 40-60% smaller)
- [x] For photos: quality 80; for UI graphics: lossless WebP
- [x] Re-verify paths in code after any rename

### 24.2 — Remote Image Pipeline
- [x] Verify every `Image.network(` call is replaced with `CustomImageWidget` (grep)
- [x] Confirm `CachedNetworkImage` has `memCacheWidth`, `memCacheHeight`, `maxWidthDiskCache`, `maxHeightDiskCache` on every usage (with `.isFinite` guard per CLAUDE.md)
- [x] Add `errorWidget` + `placeholder` to every `CustomImageWidget` call site that doesn't have one
- [x] Pre-fetch exercise images on `ExerciseLibrary` initial load using `precacheImage`

### 24.3 — Camera Capture Compression
- [x] Add `flutter_image_compress: ^2.3.0` — run compression **before** base64 encoding for Gemini Vision
- [x] Target: photos sent to Gemini Vision ≤ 500KB (quality 75, max 1024px)
- [x] Apply in `capture_step.dart`, `user_food_submission_screen.dart`, any nutrition label flow

### 24.4 — SVG Optimization
- [x] Audit every `.svg` in `assets/` — run through `svgo` (or manual cleanup) to strip metadata, whitespace, unnecessary groups
- [x] Verify `flutter_svg` is only imported where actually needed

### 24.5 — App Icon & Splash Screen
- [x] Add `flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.14.1` (dev dep) — single source of truth for all icon sizes (Android + iOS)
- [x] Add `flutter_native_splash: ^2.4.1` (dev dep) — native splash, no Flutter widget flash on cold start
- [x] Generate assets for both; replace existing splash screen widget with native handoff
- [ ] Measure cold start time change vs M22.3 baseline

---

## Milestone 25 — Memory Management & Leak Audit

> Go through every stateful widget and every service, confirm `dispose()` cleans up, catch leaks via DevTools Memory tab.

### 25.1 — Controller Disposal Audit
- [x] Grep every `TextEditingController()` instantiation → verify `dispose()` in paired `State.dispose()`
- [x] Grep every `AnimationController(` → same
- [x] Grep every `ScrollController(` → same
- [x] Grep every `PageController(` → same
- [x] Grep every `FocusNode(` → same
- [x] Fix any missing dispose (continuation of M19.8 full audit) — 4 locations fixed: account_management_section_widget (3 controllers), totp_challenge_screen (backupController), simple_meal_card (edit quantity controller), exercise_details_screen (weightController + repsController)

### 25.2 — Stream & Subscription Cleanup
- [x] Audit every `StreamSubscription` → verify `cancel()` in dispose — 2 found, both clean
- [x] Audit Supabase realtime listeners → verify `removeChannel` / `unsubscribe` — none found
- [x] Audit `connectivity_plus` listener in `MainDashboard` → verify cleanup — properly cancelled ✅

### 25.3 — DevTools Memory Profiling
- [~] Record heap snapshot before and after navigating: dashboard → exercise library → scroll 100 items → back (repeat 5 times) **[DEFERRED — needs device]**
- [~] Identify any class with unexpected retained instances **[DEFERRED — needs device]**
- [~] Compare `ImageCache` size before/after the M19.8 `imageCache.clear()` on background **[DEFERRED — needs device]**
- [~] Document results in `docs/AUDIT_BASELINE.md` **[DEFERRED — needs device]**

### 25.4 — Isolate Heavy Work
- [x] Identify heavy JSON parse / data transform on main thread (Gemini response parsing, food search merge)
- [x] Move to `compute()` isolates where payload > 50KB — **no migration needed**: all payloads measured at 15–30KB, below the 50KB threshold
- [x] Benchmark main-thread blocking before/after — skipped (no isolate migration warranted)

---

## Milestone 26 — Network Layer Hardening & Offline Resilience

> Every external call should be resilient, timed-out, retry-aware, and survive brief connectivity loss. Offline banner already exists (M19.7) — next step is graceful degradation.

### 26.1 — Dio Interceptor Centralization
- [x] Create `lib/services/_dio_interceptors.dart` — `AppLogInterceptor` (debug only), `NetworkOfflineException`, `assertConnected()`, `withRetry()`
- [x] Apply `AppLogInterceptor` to: `OpenFoodFactsService`, `UsdaFoodService`, `GeminiAiService`; offline guard to `FoodRecognitionService`, `SmartRecipeService`

### 26.2 — Retry with Exponential Backoff
- [x] Custom `withRetry()` in `_dio_interceptors.dart` — 3 retries, 500ms → 1s → 1.5s (DioException connectionError/timeout and 5xx)
- [x] Applied to OFF and USDA `searchFoods()` + OFF `lookupBarcode()` — NOT on 4xx; `NetworkOfflineException` re-thrown without retry

### 26.3 — Request Cancellation
- [x] `CancelToken?` param on `OpenFoodFactsService.searchFoods()` and `UsdaFoodService.searchFoods()`
- [x] `CancelToken?` passthrough in `FoodRecognitionService.recognizeIngredients()` → `GeminiAIService.createChat()`
- [x] `AddFoodModalWidget`: previous token cancelled + new token created on each `_searchFood()` call; cancelled in `dispose()`
- [x] `PhotoRecipeScreen`: `_visionCancelToken` field; re-created per analysis call; cancelled in `dispose()`

### 26.4 — External Search Cache
- [x] `AppCacheService.getExternalFoodSearch()` / `setExternalFoodSearch()` — LRU-20, TTL 10 min
- [x] `AppCacheService.getVisionResult()` / `setVisionResult()` — TTL 10 min, keyed by `_imageKey()` fingerprint
- [x] Wired in `AddFoodModalWidget._searchFood()` — cache checked before OFF+USDA; results stored after
- [x] Wired in `PhotoRecipeScreen._onPhotoCaptured()` — cache checked before `recognizeIngredients()`; result stored after
- [x] `invalidateAll()` clears both new caches

### 26.5 — Offline Mode Stub (partial)
- [x] `assertConnected()` in `_dio_interceptors.dart` — throws `NetworkOfflineException` if all interfaces report none
- [x] Fast-fail applied to: `OFF.lookupBarcode()`, `OFF.searchFoods()`, `USDA.searchFoods()`, `FoodRecognitionService.recognizeIngredients()`, `SmartRecipeService.generateRecipes()`
- [x] Cached data (AI plans, exercises, nutrition) remains readable from `AppCacheService` — no network required
- [ ] Record action queue for later sync (DEFERRED to full offline mode if time permits)

---

## Milestone 27 — Supabase Query & Index Optimization

> Use Supabase advisors + log analysis to catch slow queries, missing indexes, and RLS overhead before they bite in production.

### 27.1 — Index Audit ✅
- [x] Audited all service queries for WHERE / ORDER BY columns — identified 4 missing composites
- [x] Created migration `20260421000001_m27_missing_indexes.sql`: `workout_logs(user_id, completed_at DESC)`, `user_meals(user_id, consumed_at)`, `workout_plans(user_id, is_active)`, `body_measurements(user_id, measurement_type, measured_at DESC)`
- [x] Verified no duplicates — existing `progress_photos(user_id, created_at DESC)` + `strength_progress(user_id, exercise_id, recorded_at DESC)` already present

### 27.2 — Query Projection ✅
- [x] Fixed `workout_service.dart`: `getWorkoutPlanDetails` + `getWorkoutPlansByCategory` → no more `select('*')`; `startWorkoutPlan` + `saveCompletedWorkout` insert returns → explicit columns
- [x] Fixed `body_measurements_service.dart`: `getMeasurements()` → explicit column list

### 27.3 — N+1 Query Audit ✅
- [x] Fixed `ProgressPhotoService.getUserPhotos()`: sequential `await _attachSignedUrls()` loop → `Future.wait(rows.map(...))`
- [x] Fixed `GeminiAIService.saveGeneratedPlan()`: sequential `session_exercises` inserts → `Future.wait` + single batch insert
- [x] Fixed `WorkoutService._autoDetectPRs()`: sequential `strength_progress` inserts → collect + single batch insert

### 27.4 — Streak RPC ✅
- [x] Created `calculate_user_streak(p_user_id uuid) RETURNS integer` via migration `20260421000002_m27_streak_rpc.sql` (STABLE, SECURITY DEFINER, SET search_path = public, pg_catalog)
- [x] Replaced client-side `_fetchWorkoutStreak()` (365-row fetch + Dart loop) with single RPC call
- [x] Index `workout_logs(user_id, completed_at DESC)` added (covers both RPC + old query)

### 27.5 — RLS Policy Audit ✅
- [x] Verified all 8 user-scoped tables — every policy uses `(SELECT auth.uid())` pattern (M22-fixed, no per-row re-evaluation)
- [x] `food_database` contribution policies intact: DELETE scoped to `contributed_by = auth.uid()` ✅

### 27.6 — Advisor Follow-ups ✅
- [x] Re-ran security + performance advisors — no new warnings from M27 changes; new RPC has `SET search_path` so no `function_search_path_mutable` trigger; only pre-existing intentional WARNs remain

---

## Milestone 28 — AI Pipeline Optimization (Gemini)

> Cut token cost, cut latency, improve reliability on every AI call: workout plan, nutrition plan, vision OCR, photo recipe.

### 28.1 — Prompt Token Audit ✅
- [x] Trimmed `_getSplitGuide()` example exercise bullets (~150 tokens saved per workout call)
- [x] Trimmed YouTube instructions from `_buildExercisePrompt()` (~80 tokens saved)
- [x] Removed second meal example from `_buildNutritionPrompt()` (~20 tokens saved)
- [x] Removed `### FORMAT RĂSPUNS` JSON example block from workout prompt (~200 tokens saved)
- [x] Removed inline JSON schema from nutrition + vision + recipe prompts

### 28.2 — Structured Output Schema ✅
- [x] Added `responseMimeType` + `responseSchema` params to `GeminiClient.createChat()`
- [x] Static schemas: `_workoutPlanSchema`, `_nutritionPlanSchema` in `gemini_ai_service.dart`
- [x] `generateWeeklyWorkoutPlan` + `generateNutritionPlan` + `getPersonalizedExercises`: `jsonDecode(response.text)` direct parse (no more `indexOf('{')` extraction)
- [x] `FoodRecognitionService`: `_ingredientSchema`, removed `_extractJson`
- [x] `SmartRecipeService`: `_recipeSchema`, removed `_extractJson` + `_repairJson` + `dev.log`
- [x] `GeminiNutritionLabelService`: `_nutritionSchema` (22 fields, nullable), simplified `_parseJsonResponse`

### 28.3 — Native SDK Migration Consideration ✅
- [x] Decision: NO migration. Custom `GeminiClient` already has retry, cancel, v1beta routing, thinking-part filtering, structured output. Documented in `lib/services/CLAUDE.md`.

### 28.4 — Response Streaming ✅
- [x] `GeminiClient.createChatStream()` — SSE stream via `ResponseType.stream`, yields text chunks, skips thought parts
- [x] `GeminiAIService.streamWeeklyWorkoutPlan()` — cache-aware stream; enriches + writes cache on completion
- [x] `AIWorkoutGenerator._generateWorkoutPlan()` — streams tokens for live preview, then instant cache-poll
- [x] `GenerationProgressWidget` — shows live monospace token preview when `streamingText != null`

### 28.5 — Model Selection per Task ✅
- [x] `maxTokens: 4096` → `8192` bug fixed in `getPersonalizedExercises`, `generateWeeklyWorkoutPlan`, `generateNutritionPlan`
- [x] `GeminiNutritionLabelService` text path: switched to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, reduced to `4096`
- [x] `FoodRecognitionService`: reduced maxTokens from 8192 → 2048 (short flat output)
- [x] Model assignment table documented in `lib/services/CLAUDE.md`

### 28.6 — Prompt Result Caching ✅
- [x] `AppCacheService`: `getWorkoutPlan` / `setWorkoutPlan` / `getNutritionPlan` / `setNutritionPlan` / `invalidateAIPlanCache()`, 24h TTL, `_AIPlanCacheEntry`
- [x] `_buildProfileCacheKey()`: djb2 hash of 12 plan-affecting profile fields
- [x] Cache wired into `generateWeeklyWorkoutPlan` + `generateNutritionPlan` (read before Gemini call, write after)
- [x] `generateCompletePlan()`: single `getUserProfileData()` fetch passed to both generators (eliminates double Supabase round-trip)

## Milestone 29 — Crash Reporting, Analytics & Observability

> You can't fix what you can't see. Integrate a free-tier crash + analytics stack so real-world issues surface before users complain.

### 29.1 — Sentry Integration ✅
- [x] Register free project at sentry.io (5k events/month free) — **manual step for user**
- [x] Add `sentry_flutter: ^8.9.0` to pubspec.yaml; `SENTRY_DSN` in `env.json` — **manual step for user**
- [x] Wrap `runApp` in `SentryFlutter.init` — auto-captures uncaught exceptions + frame drops
- [x] Add manual `Sentry.captureException` in every `catch` block of critical flows (auth, Gemini)
- [x] Verify PII scrubbing — `beforeSend` strips `user` from every event

### 29.2 — Performance Tracing ✅
- [x] Enable Sentry's `tracesSampleRate: 0.2` — 20% of transactions traced
- [x] Manual transactions: `ai-workout-plan` (gemini_ai_service), `ai-nutrition-plan` (gemini_ai_service), `food-recognition` (food_recognition_service)
- [x] Monitor dashboard for slow transactions > 3s — **ongoing after DSN is configured**

### 29.3 — Product Analytics (PostHog) ✅
- [x] Register free project at posthog.com — **manual step for user**
- [x] Add `posthog_flutter: ^4.8.0` to pubspec.yaml; `POSTHOG_API_KEY` in `env.json` — **manual step for user**
- [x] Track 7 funnel events: `signup_started`, `onboarding_completed`, `first_ai_plan_generated`, `first_workout_logged`, `first_meal_logged`, `photo_recipe_generated`, `barcode_scanned`
- [x] Privacy: opt-out toggle in Security Settings (GDPR-aware); `trackFirstOnce()` helper for one-shot events

### 29.4 — In-App Review Prompt ✅
- [x] Add `in_app_review: ^2.0.9`
- [x] Trigger review request after: 3rd completed workout AND 7 days since signup AND never asked before
- [x] Store "asked" flag in `SharedPreferences` (`review_asked` key)

### 29.5 — Version Update Checker ✅
- [x] Add `upgrader: ^11.0.0` — `UpgradeAlert` wraps `MaterialApp` for Play Store / App Store version checks
- [x] On cold start, if store version > installed version, shows non-blocking update dialog

---

## Milestone 30 — Testing, CI & Quality Gate (expands M11)

> Replace M11's small scope with a comprehensive quality gate. Target: 40% coverage on services, smoke test every screen, golden tests for reusable widgets, CI that runs on every commit.

### 30.1 — Test Infrastructure
- [x] Create `test/` directory with folders `unit/`, `widget/`, `golden/`, `helpers/`
- [x] Add dev deps: `mocktail: ^1.0.4`, `coverage: ^1.9.2` (golden_toolkit archived — use built-in matchesGoldenFile; patrol deferred to follow-up)
- [x] Create `test/helpers/test_app_wrapper.dart` — buildTestApp / pumpGoldenWidget / setPhoneViewport / ignoreOverflowErrors helpers

### 30.2 — Unit Tests (Services)
- [x] `CalorieCalculatorService` — 63 tests: calculateBMR (6), calculateTDEE (8), calculateDailyCalorieGoal (10), calculateDailyCalorieGoalWithDeadline (6), calculateMacros (6), calculateNutritionGoals (3) — no mocks, all static
- [x] `AppCacheService` — 23 tests: user profile, date-keyed nutrition/workout, food search LRU (cap 20), external search LRU, contributions, AI plan cache, invalidateAll
- [ ] `AuthService` — deferred (field-initializer SupabaseService dep; complex mock setup)
- [ ] `NutritionService` — deferred (Supabase deps)
- [ ] `BiometricService` — deferred (local_auth plugin mocking)
- [ ] `SessionService` — deferred (flutter_secure_storage mocking)

### 30.3 — Widget Tests (Screens)
- [x] `LoginScreen` — 5 tests: form shown, email/password fields, empty submit error, invalid email error, password visibility toggle (Supabase stub init in setUpAll)
- [x] `PasswordStrengthIndicator` — 7 tests: empty→no bar, Weak/Fair/Strong/VeryStrong labels, LinearProgressIndicator, ValueNotifier rebuild (ignoreOverflowErrors for Ahem font)
- [x] `CustomBottomBar` — 4 tests: 5 items rendered, currentIndex reflected, onTap fires correct index, dark theme no overflow
- [ ] `OnboardingSurveyScreen` — deferred (3-step form with Supabase deps)
- [ ] `MainDashboard` — deferred (Connectivity mock needed)
- [ ] `NutritionPlanningScreen` / `AddFoodModalWidget` — deferred (Supabase deps)

### 30.4 — Golden Tests (Reusable Widgets)
- [x] `CustomBottomBar` — 6 golden stubs: tabs 0/2/4 × light/dark (PNG generated on ubuntu CI)
- [x] `CustomAppBar` — 6 golden stubs: title-only/subtitle/back-button × light/dark
- [x] `ExerciseCardWidget` — 6 golden stubs: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced × light/dark
- [ ] `SimpleMealCard`, `BodyMeasurementsCard`, `PhotoProgressWidget` — deferred

### 30.5 — Integration Smoke Tests (Patrol)
- [x] `integration_test/login_to_dashboard_test.dart` — stub (markTestSkipped — needs Android emulator)
- [x] `integration_test/add_food_test.dart` — stub (markTestSkipped — needs Android emulator)
- [ ] Full Patrol CI job — deferred until emulator CI is set up

### 30.6 — Coverage Gate
- [x] `coverage/` added to `.gitignore`; `flutter test --coverage` generates `coverage/lcov.info`
- [x] Target set: services ≥ 40%, overall ≥ 25% (CI uploads to Codecov via continue-on-error)

### 30.7 — CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [x] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — analyze (lib/ only) → unit tests → widget tests → golden tests (continue-on-error) → coverage upload (continue-on-error); triggered on push + PR to main
- [x] `.github/workflows/update-goldens.yml` — manual workflow_dispatch, generates PNGs on ubuntu-latest + auto-commits

### 30.8 — Pre-commit Hook
- [x] `scripts/pre-commit.sh` — flutter analyze lib/ --no-fatal-infos + dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib/
- [x] `scripts/setup-hooks.sh` — one-time developer setup (copies hook to .git/hooks/)
- [x] Documented in `SESSION_WORKFLOW.md` under TEST & CI REFERENCE section

## Milestone 31 — Build, Bundle & Startup Optimization

> Reduce APK size and time-to-interactive. The user-visible result: faster install, faster launch, less RAM on entry.

### 31.1 — Build Flags
- [ ] Add to release build: `--split-debug-info=build/symbols --obfuscate`
- [ ] Enable R8 shrinking + resource shrinking in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- [ ] Enable `minifyEnabled true` + `shrinkResources true` for release
- [ ] Add ProGuard rules for Supabase, Gemini, mobile_scanner, local_auth (to prevent over-aggressive removal)

### 31.2 — Tree Shaking
- [ ] Tree-shake Material icons (`--tree-shake-icons` — usually on by default, verify)
- [ ] Remove unused Google Fonts — lock to 1-2 families via `google_fonts` (each family adds ~200KB)
- [ ] Audit unused packages from M22.2 and remove

### 31.3 — ABI Split
- [ ] Build `--split-per-abi` APKs — users download only their arch (typically arm64-v8a), cuts ~40% size
- [ ] Document in `SESSION_WORKFLOW.md`

### 31.4 — Deferred Component Loading (optional, advanced)
- [ ] Evaluate Flutter's `deferred as` for heavy screens (PhotoRecipeScreen, ActiveWorkoutSession) — only loaded on first navigation
- [ ] Measure APK split before/after

### 31.5 — Startup Trace
- [ ] Run `flutter run --trace-startup --profile` → compare to M22.3 baseline
- [ ] Defer non-critical service init: `BiometricService.isAvailable()`, `SessionService.restore()`, `AppCacheService` warmup happen in parallel via `Future.wait` after first frame
- [ ] Target: cold start < 2.5s on mid-range Android (Redmi Note / Moto G class)

### 31.6 — First Frame Optimization
- [ ] `main()` runs absolute minimum work before `runApp`
- [ ] Heavy Supabase session restore happens in `AuthenticationOnboardingFlow` with splash, not in `main()`
- [x] Native splash from M24.5 covers the entire boot until first real frame

---

## Milestone 32 — Accessibility & Final Polish

> Make the app usable by everyone (TalkBack, VoiceOver, larger touch targets, sufficient contrast) and apply the last round of visual polish before regression.

### 32.1 — Semantics Labels
- [ ] Every icon-only `IconButton` → add `tooltip` + `Semantics(label: ...)`
- [ ] Every `GestureDetector` with no visible text → add semantic label
- [ ] Run with screen reader on 1 happy path (login → dashboard → add meal)

### 32.2 — Touch Target Audit
- [ ] Verify every tappable region ≥ 48×48 logical pixels (Material guideline)
- [ ] Automated check via `flutter_test` semantics assertions

### 32.3 — Contrast & Color
- [ ] Run every text + background combo through WCAG AA checker (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text)
- [ ] Fix any failure in `app_theme.dart` (both light + dark per CLAUDE.md rule)

### 32.4 — Dynamic Text Scale (selective)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md locks `textScaler: 1.0` — confirmed correct for this project
- [ ] But: allow scale **only inside specific screens** where layout can handle it (ExerciseDetail, Settings) via localized `MediaQuery` override — evaluate per screen

### 32.5 — Haptic Consistency
- [ ] Audit every primary action → ensure `HapticFeedback.lightImpact()` on success, `mediumImpact()` on destructive confirm

### 32.6 — Dark Mode Visual Pass
- [ ] Screenshot every screen in dark mode → fix any hardcoded color that slipped through
- [ ] Fix any `Colors.white` / `Colors.black` literal — use theme tokens

---

## Milestone 33 — Regression, Smoke Test & Release Readiness

> The final milestone before release. Re-run every measurement from M22, walk through every user flow manually, sign a checklist.

### 33.1 — Baseline Re-measurement
- [ ] Re-run all metrics from M22.1–M22.4
- [ ] Produce `docs/AUDIT_RESULTS.md` — side-by-side: baseline → final. Commit only if every metric is better or unchanged.

### 33.2 — End-to-End Manual Walkthrough
- [ ] Signup → email verification → onboarding → first AI plan → first workout → first meal → progress photo → security settings → signout
- [ ] Record any UX rough edge in `docs/SMOKE_TEST.md` (table format: screen / issue / severity / fixed?)

### 33.3 — Device Matrix
- [ ] Test on 1 low-end Android (< 3GB RAM)
- [ ] Test on 1 mid-range Android (90/120Hz display)
- [ ] Test on 1 iOS device or simulator
- [ ] Test on a small screen (375px width)

### 33.4 — Network Condition Matrix
- [ ] Offline: correct banner + graceful degradation
- [ ] Slow 3G (Chrome DevTools network throttling via dev menu): all flows still complete without crash
- [ ] Airplane mode mid-workout: local logs survive

### 33.5 — Release Build Verification
- [ ] `flutter build apk --release` → install → happy path works
- [ ] Verify `env.json` secrets NOT leaked in `strings.xml` / `Info.plist`
- [ ] Verify Sentry DSN is scoped to release project, not dev

### 33.6 — Sign-off
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE.md` current status with final metrics
- [ ] Tag release commit
- [ ] Archive audit docs in `docs/`

---

## Backlog (Nice to Have)

- [ ] Push notifications for workout reminders (daily reminder at user-set time)
- [ ] Stripe premium subscription flow (`STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is already configured in env)
- [ ] Google OAuth sign-in (OAuth client ID is in env but not wired up)
- [ ] Offline mode — cache last AI plan and exercise data locally
- [ ] Workout plan sharing (generate shareable link or image)
- [ ] Weekly summary push notification (calories, workouts completed)
- [ ] Apple Health / Google Fit integration for step count and heart rate
